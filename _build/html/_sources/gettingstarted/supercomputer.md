# 3. Working with the supercomputer

## Creating your Accounts and Preparing your System 

 

### Create an account on XSEDE 

- Go to https://portal.xsede.org/ 
    - Click on the blue “Create Account” button under “Get Started on XSEDE” 
    - Fill out everything that has the * next to it and submit, once you get an email with a verification code you will be able to choose a username and password for your account. 
    - Let Dr. Cueva-Parra know what your username is once you create your account so that he can add you to the allocation. 
    - Underneath the welcome message, you will find the “Profile” button click on that and then on the “DUO” button and to go through the process to add 2FA 

- If you are using a Windows OS download a SSH client software on your computer. the recommended one is PuTTY found at https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html

- It can take upwards of 12 hours to get your accounts activated for both Expanse and Bridges 2 though it would usually be quicker. 

- Once PSC has set up your Kavaros account, they will send you an email with your username which you would then use at https://apr.psc.edu to create your password.
    - After you finish making your password you will then be able to access the Bridges 2 supercomputer via either the XSEDE SSO_Hub using gsissh bridges2 or through the command line ssh <username>@bridges2.psc.edu with <username> being the username PSC sent you through email. 
- To check if your Expanse account is set up you will have to go to https://portal.xsede.org/group/xup/accounts and make sure you have a local username for Expanse 
    - Once your Expanse account is set up you can either log in through the SSO_hub once again (gsissh expanse), or through the more user-friendly expanse portal at https://portal.expanse.sdsc.edu/
